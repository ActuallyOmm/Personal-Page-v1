            As mentioned in the box above, I'm Omm. I'm an aspiring software
            engineer in my 3rd year, studying Computer Science at the
            Univerisity of Surrey.

            Throughout my years of academia, I've been able to further develop
            and refine my abstraction skills within a programming setting. As a
            result of this, I've grown a liking to object oriented programming,
            especially in backend development when designing a web application.

            Most recently, I was given the opportunity to be a Peer Assisited
            Lab Helper for the Operating Systems module (COM1032). This role
            taught me how to effective communicate complex concepts in a simple
            comprehensible manner.
